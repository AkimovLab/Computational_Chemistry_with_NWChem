# Lab 8: Calculation of Excited States: Electronic Absorption Spectra

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Basic theory of MD.

In this Lab, we will conduct classical **molecular dynamics (MD)** simulations of some molecular systems. 
The goal of the MD simulations is obtaining **"molecular movies"**, also known as **trajectories** – the sequence of geometries reflecting 
how the atoms evolve according to Newtonian dynamics. The key equations here are:

$$ r\dot_{i,\alpha} = \frac{ p_{i,\alpha} }{ m_i} $$

$$ p\dot_{i,\alpha} = F_{i,\alpha}(r_{1,x}, r_{1,y}, r_{1,z},...,r_{N,x},r_{N,y},r_{N,z}) $$
